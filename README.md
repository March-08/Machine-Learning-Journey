Implementations of ML and DL solution during my learning experience


## Machine Learning

- [Solution to Titanic-Machine Learning from Disaster Kaggle's challenge](https://github.com/March-08/Machine-Learning-Journey/blob/main/Titanic/Titanic_Marcello_Politi.ipynb)  
    
  Kaggle challenge : https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview  
  In this code I developed a custom sklearn tranformer.   
  I used a pipeline to preprocess the data.   
  The model selection was run using both randomized_search and optuna.  
  
  
## Deep Learning
 
- [CNN for pneumonia classification from chest X Rays images](https://github.com/March-08/Machine-Learning-Journey/tree/main/Pneumonia-Chest-X-Rays-Classifier/Pneumonia-Chest-X-Rays-Classifier-main)
     
    The dataset provided by Kaggle and available at https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal). The Pneumonia folder contains images of two different categories virus and bacteria, so with the additional normal category we have 3 different classes.

 - [Best System Award EVALITA 2020 : Stance Detection System](https://github.com/March-08/Machine-Learning-Journey/tree/main/Stance_Detection_Evalita2020/Stance_Detection-master)
         
    EVALITA is a periodic evaluation campaign of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and speech tools for the Italian language, born in 2007.
    This year EVALITA provided a task called [SardiStance](http://www.di.unito.it/~tutreeb/sardistance-evalita2020/index.html), that is basically a stance detection task,         using a data-set containing Italian tweets about the [Sardines Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardines_movement).
    The task is a three-class classification task where the system has to predict whether a tweet is in favour, against or neutral/none towards the given target,                 exploiting only textual information, i.e. the text of the tweet.
    The dataset will include short documents taken from Twitter.
    The evaluation will be performed according to the standard metrics known in literature (accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score)
